            <p>Every character in Genshin has a unique skillset and may be built differently depending on personal preference. Each character in Genshin Impact uses one of 5 weapon types - claymore, catalyst, polearm, sword, or bow. What weapon type a character uses is already decided for you. Albedo, for example, uses a sword. However, you can choose which weapon of that type a character will equip. Since different weapons have different substats and passives, this means your first step to building a character is deciding on a weapon. There are a lot of weapons in the game, so this decision will vary depending on your own account. To start off with, there are a few stand-out weapon options from each weapon type that you can default to if needed.
