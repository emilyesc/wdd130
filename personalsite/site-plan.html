      <p>
        Genshin Impact is a game where your first combat goal is to create a strong character. Your second combat goal is to combine four characters into a single, synergestic, team. 
        Each character has their own elemental alignment, which can be seen when you view any character. They can be either Pyro (fire), Hydro (water), Cryo (ice), Dendro (plants), Geo (earth), Anemo (wind), Electro (lighting).
          On their own, these elements don't do very much. However, once you combine characters into teams, these elements will react with each other. For example, combining Cryo and Hydro will cause Freeze. When in doubt, build a team, and the characters in it, to capitalize on one of these elemental reactions.

      <h3>Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Every character in Genshin has a unique skillset, and may be built differently depending on personal preference. 
          Each character in Genshin Impact uses one of 5 weapon types - claymore, catalyst, polearm, sword, or bow. What weapon type a character uses is already decided for you. Albedo, for example, uses a sword. 
          However, you can chose which weapon of that type a character will equip. Since different weapons have different substats and passives, this means your first step to building a character is deciding on a weapon.
          
          There are a lot of weapons in the game, so this decision will vary depending on your own account. To start off with, there are a few stand-out weapon options from each weapon type that you can default to if needed.

      <h3>Teams</h3>
      <p>
        The first step in buidling a team is to designate a main damage-dealer. For example, I want to use Ayaka as a main damage-dealer. 
          I would then decide what elemental reaction I want to build the team around. Ayaka, as a cryo user, works well with freeze. 
         Once I know those two things, it's important to add supports to the team. Supports are incredible for boosting a team's performance. I can add a healer to keep 
          the team alive. Support characters can be given supportive artifact sets, such as the Noblesse Oblige set. I can bring supports that will apply specific elements and thus enable the elemental reaction of the team.
